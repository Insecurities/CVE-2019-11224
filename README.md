# Modero AMX Code Execution (CVE-2019-11224)
This repo contains a few sources about CVE-2019â€“11224 (https://link.medium.com/zukA0oCnV8) because I noticed that the link no longer works on the official NIST website. 
Modero AMX devices are essentially touch panel devices for meeting rooms, they can be observed in a lot of different environments and usually have Telnet open. 
Because they emulate a console using Telnet, there exists a code injection vulnerability through the "ping" function by using command separators. 

#  About exploit.rb
This is basically a *really* ugly ruby file which simplifies the exploit process, all you have to do is set the IP in the exploit file and run it. You'll be presented with a few different options that cat out different files on the device...
The Modero systems have been a real PITA for me so I wasn't able to get the script to recognize when a command has completed, but feel free to modify the files to your liking.
